## Overview of my work during my PhD

Non-commutative probability theory can be described as an algebraic point of view on the classical
theory of probability.
The fundamental object of classical probability is the famous triple(Ω _,_ A _,_ P). In order to construct a
non-commutative analogue of classical probability theory, one proceeds by associating to each measured
space a commutative algebra. Then, one exhibits a list of properties, including commutativity, which
characterizes the algebras obtained in this way. Removing commutativity from the list yields the
definition of a non-commutative probability space.
To be more specific, one associates to a measured space the algebra of its essentially bounded random
variables. It turns out that the algebras of the form _L_ ∞(Ω _,_ A _,_ P)are exactly the commutative von
Neumann algebras. Hence, the fundamental objects of non-commutative probability theory are von
Neumann algebras, together with the linear form that plays the role of integration. Many concepts of
classical probability, such as random variables, distribution, and independence, find counterparts in
the non-commutative setting.
In the case of independence, several meaningful definitions can be given in the non-commutative setting,
and the theory of free probability is the sub-theory of non-commutative probability theory in which
one adopts Voiculescu’s notion of free independence. This theory, developed by Voiculescu himself and
also, notably, by Speicher, proved to be very efficient in constructing a framework for the study of
large random matrices.


Let me give a brief overview of the notions and objects I got acquainted with during my PhD.
{ Von Neumann algebras, _C?_ -algebras and their (braided) tensor products. The notion of freeness
plays a major role in my work along with combinatorial tools such as free cumulants and analytic
ones such as the _R_ -transform.
{ Lie algebras and compact Lie groups (their structure and classification). They are the state spaces
of all the classical stochastic processes that are defined and studied in my work. I also acquired
some familiarity with stochastic calculus on such ‘curved’ spaces. The notion of Poisson–Lie group
appears in one of the directions of research that I am interested in.
{ Principal bundles, their differential geometry, and connections on them. I studied in detail the
symplectic structure of the space of connections over a surface.
In my PhD, I studied the **convergence in non-commutative distribution of Brownian motions
defined on complex and real Lie groups, including non-compact, and even maximally non-
compact ones**. In particular, I studied the behaviour of the Brownian motion on the pseudo-orthogonal
group _O_ ( _p, q_ )when _p_ and _q_ are large.
In another direction, I tried to **define Yang–Mills theories associated with the largest possible
class of algebras of symmetries, using concepts from non-commutative probability theory**
and the procedure of non-commutativisation that I briefly described in the first lines of this section.
For some of these theories, that I propose to call higher dimensional master fields, and that I will
describe in the next section, I gave matricial approximations.
A third direction that I investigated during my PhD, **and that I would like to develop during the
next years, is the enhancement of non-commutative probability theory with concepts of
rough path theory.** During the academic year 2017-2018, I organised a reading group with doctoral
fellows to start the investigation of the relations between these two major theories.
