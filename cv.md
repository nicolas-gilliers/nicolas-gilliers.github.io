I completed my Master program in probability and stochastic modelisation at the university
of Jussieu in the laboratory of Probability and stochastic modelisation (formerly known as
LPMA). Following advices from my PhD advisor, I followed lectures on Poisson geometry,
geometric quantization and Lie groups.

- 2014 – 2019 Phd Student
As a PhD student, I am working with Thierry Lévy (LPMA). My first three years were funded
by a PhD scholarship granted by the Ministry of Education.

PhD students of the laboratory are meeting on a weekly basis from September to June at the
LPMA Laboratory. Talks are about proability and their interactions with other fields such as
geometry, biology, finance...

- 2017 - 2018 Organizer of a reading group on non commutative probability and rough paths
theory. Students interested in rough paths theory and non commutative probability meet on a weekly
basis to read in common a recent article published by Schott and Deya to introduce us to non
commutative probability in relation with rough path theory.
