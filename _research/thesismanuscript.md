excerpt: "Abstract.This thesis is devoted to the study of two quite different questions, which are re-lated by the tools that we use to study them. The first question is that of the definition of latticegauge theories with a non-commutative structure group. Here, by non-commutative, we do notmean non-Abelian, but instead non-commutative in the general sense of non-commutative ge-ometry.  The second question is that of the behaviour of Brownian diffusions on non-compactmatrix  groups  of  a  specific  kind,  namely  groups  of  pseudo-orthogonal,  pseudo-unitary  orpseudo-symplectic matrices. In the first chapter, we investigate lattice and continuous quantum gauge theories on theEuclidean plane with a structure group that is replaced by a Zhang algebra.  Zhang algebras are non-commutative analogues of groups and contain the class of Voiculescu’s dual groups. We are interested in non-commutative analogues of random gauge fields, which we describethrough the random holonomy that they induce. We propose a general definition of a holonomy field with Zhang gauge symmetry, and construct such a field starting from a quantum Lévy process on a Zhang algebra.  As an application, we define higher dimensional generalizations of the so-called master field. In the second chapter, we study matricial approximations of higher dimensional masterfields constructed in the previous chapter. These approximations (in non-commutative distri-bution) are obtained by extracting blocks of a Brownian unitary diffusion (with entries in thealgebras of real, complex or quaternionic numbers) and letting the dimension of these blockstend to infinity.  We divide our study into two parts: in the first one, we extract square blocks while in the second one we allow rectangular blocks.  In both cases,  free probability theoryappears as the natural framework in which the limiting distributions are most accurately described. In  the  last  two  chapters,  we  use  tools  introduced  (Zhang  algebras  and  coloured  Brauerdiagrams) in the first two ones to study Brownian motion on pseudo-unitary matrices in high dimensions.   We prove convergence in non-commutative distribution of the pseudo-unitary Brownian motions we consider to free with amalgamation semi-groups under the hypothesis of convergence of the normalized signature of the metric.  In the split case, meaning that at least asymptotically the metric has as much negative directions as positive ones, the limit distribution is that of a free Lévy process, which is a solution of a free stochastic differential equation. We leave open the question of such a realization of the limiting distribution in the general case.  In addition we provide (intriguing) numerical evidences for the convergence of the spectral distribution of such random matrices and make two conjectures. At the end of the thesis, we prove asymptotic normality for the fluctuations.
