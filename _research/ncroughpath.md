title: "The non-commutative signature of a path"
collection: research
permalink: /research/ncroughpath
excerpt: "We introduce a class of operators associated to the signature of a smooth path
X with values in a C* algebra. These operators serve as basis of Taylor expansions
of solutions to controlled differential equations of interest in non-commutative probability.
They are defined by fully contracting iterated integrals of X, seen as tensors, with the
product of the underlying algebra. Were it considered that partial contractions should be included, we explain
how these operators yield a trajectory on a group of representations of a combinatorial Hopf
monoid. To clarify the role of partial contractions, we build an alternative group-valued
trajectory whose increments embody full-contractions operators alone. We obtain therefore
a notion of signature, which seems more appropriate in non-commutative probability.
