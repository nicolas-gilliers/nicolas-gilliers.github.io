title: "Non-commutative geometric rough paths"
collection: research
permalink: /research/ncroughpath
excerpt: "We foster the work initiated in 2013 on integration against trajectories with low Hölder
regularity valued in an infinite dimensional Banach algebra by A. Deya and R. Schott. In particular, we
introduce a new notion of non-commutative rough path above an Hölder path, weaker than the usual
notion from Lyon’s rough path theory, with the objective of constructing a solution theory for a certain
class of differential equations arising in non-commutative probability. We show that, in contrary to the
finite dimensional setting, there is no underlying Hopf algebra which convolution group accomodates
truly irregular n-c rough paths, instead, we use the language of Hairer’s theory of regularity structures"
