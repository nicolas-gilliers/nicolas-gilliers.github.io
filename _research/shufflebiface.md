excerpt: "One can build an operatorial model for freeness by considering either the right-handed either the left-handed representation of algebras of operators acting on the free product of the underlying pointed Hilbert spaces. Considering both at the same time, that is computing distributions of operators in the algebra generated by the left- and right-handed representations, led Voiculescu in 2013 to define and study bifreeness and, in the sequel, triggered the development of an extension of noncommutative probability now frequently referred to as multi-faced (two-faced in the example given above). Many examples of two-faced independences emerged these past years. Of great interest to us are biBoolean, bifree and Type I bimonotone independences. In this paper we extend the preLie calculus prevailing to free, Boolean and monotone moment-cumulant relations initiated by K. Ebrahimi-Fard and F. Patras to their above mentioned two-faced equivalents."
