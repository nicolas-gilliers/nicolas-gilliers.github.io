Abstract : We investigate lattice and continuous quantum gauge theories on the Euclidean plane with a structure group that is replaced by a Zhang algebra. Zhang algebras are non-commutative analogues of groups and contain the class of Voiculescu's dual groups. We are interested in non-commutative analogues of random gauge fields, which we describe through the random holonomy that they induce. We propose a general definition of a holonomy field with Zhang gauge symmetry, and construct a such fields starting from a quantum LÃ©vy process on a Zhang algebra. As an application, we define higher dimensional generalizations of the so-called master field.
