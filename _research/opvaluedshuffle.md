title: "Shuffle algebra point of view on operator-valued probability theory"
collection: research
permalink: /research/shuffleop
excerpt: "We extend the shuffle algebra perspective on scalar-valued non-commutative probability
theory to the operator-valued case. We start by associating to the operator-valued distribution and free
cumulants of a random variable elements of the homomorphism operad corresponding to the algebra
acting on the operator-valued probability space. Using notions coming from higher category theory, we
are able to define an unshuffle Hopf algebra like structure on a properad of non-crossing partitions. We do
the exact same construction for a properad of word insertions and construct an unshuffle morphism, the
splitting map, between the two unshuffle Hopf algebra. We obtain two half-shuffle fixed point equations
corresponding to, respectively, free and boolean moment-cumulants relations."
