title: "Asymptotic cyclic-conditional freeness of random matrices"
collection: research
permalink: /research/twistedfactorization
excerpt: "Voiculescu's freeness emerges in computing the asymptotic of spectra of polynomials on random matrices with eigenspaces in generic positions: they are randomly rotated with a uniform unitary random matrix U. In this article we elaborate on the previous point by proposing a random matrix model, which we name the Vortex model, where U has the law of a uniform unitary random matrix conditioned to leave invariant one deterministic vector v. In the high dimensional limit, we show that matrices randomly rotated by the matrix U are asymptotically conditionally free with respect to the normalized trace and the state vector v. To describe second order asymptotics, we define cyclic-conditional freeness, a new notion of independence unifying infinitesimal freeness, cyclic-monotone independence and cyclic-Boolean independence. The infinitesimal distribution in the Vortex model can be computed thanks to this new independence. Finally, we elaborate on the Vortex model in order to build random matrix models for ordered freeness and for indented independence."
