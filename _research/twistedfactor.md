title: "Twisted factorization of the $T$-transform: two more proofs"
collection: research
permalink: /research/twistedfactorization
excerpt: "The amalgamated $T$-transform of a non-commutative distribution introduced by K. Dykema is a fundamental tool to compute distributions of random variables in free probability theory. In fact, the $T$ transform factorizes over multiplication of free random variable, but in a rather non-trivial way. In this article, we give a graphical simple proof of this property and a second one, more conceptual in the abstract setting of an operad with multiplication."
